<h2>Short Description</h2><br>
The purpose of this document is to research web-accessibility and SEO scores for 5 museum websites, then report on those scores and explain what can be learned from this research.<br>

<h2>Research Summary</h2><br>
I chose five museums of varying public profiles, ranging from very well-known museums to more obscure ones, in the hopes that I might see a range of web-accessibility and learn what issues plague both types of museum websites. The website with the highest Web Accessibility and
SEO score was the Louvre Museum, which is unsurprising as it is one of the highest-profile and most visited museums in the world. I was shocked to see a perfect lighthouse score for this website, and intend to return to this site when learning what a highly accessible site looks like.
The site ranking lowest in web-accessibility was the Museum of Death, with a score of 68. I was not surprised when Lighthouse reported that the site had an insufficient contrast ratio between background and foreground colors, since some of the text is yellow against black. Lighthouse also reported that
"form elements do not have associated labels," which would make this website difficult for screen readers. While the Museum of Death had a low accessibility score, the lowest SEO score belonged to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, with a score of 75. The main issue, from what I could find,
is that LACMA's home page does not have descriptive text and the links are not crawlable, which, according to Lighthouse, "anchors elements links to an appropriate destination." The site with the highest SEO score, the Louvre Museum, had none of these issues with descriptive text. I was surprised to see such
a high-profile museum as LACMA have such low accessibility and SEO scores whereas a more obscure museum, like the National Steinbeck Center, did pretty well in accessibility. Similarly, the Palazzo Ducale Museum in Venice, a relatively high-profile museum, did significantly worse than another popular European Museum, the Louvre.
The Pallazzo Ducale Museum ranked low in accessibility primarily for issues with names and labels. For example, the site does not have [alt] attributes for images. According to Lighthouse, "informative elements should aim for short, descriptive alternate text." All this being said, I feel like I can learn more from the sites with lower
SEO and accessibility scores that from sites, like the Louvre Museum, with perfect scores. The most common issue among these sites was a lack of descriptive text and [alt] attributes for images. <br>
